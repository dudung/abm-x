# Concept
Interaction between particles in granular system, mesoscopic clusters of fluid molecules while flowing in a channel, growing cells in biological system, and agents in some complex and artificial environments are basically the same. There are agents, e.g. particles, clusters of molecules, cells, people, and the surrounding environment. Each agent can interact with other agents and also with their environment. For granular and fluid sistems the agents are normally pasive, but for biological and social system they are usually active. More general forms of interaction between different level of agents and environment are proposed in this work, where the system should work for physical, chemical, biological, social, political and any systems of interest.

## A short history
After learning in brief about Molecular Dynamics (MD) method, inventing Single Fluid Volume Element (SFVE) method [[1](#ref1)]
based on Finite Diference (FD) and MD for water flow in self-siphon, doing post-doc about Multi-particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) [[2](#ref2)], and implementing Agent-Based Model (ABM) for physical system [[3](#ref3)], farming [[4](#ref4)], costumer dynamics [[5](#ref5)], and a very simple traffic flow [[6](#ref6)],  let's say -- a consiousness arose, which induced the birth of ``abm-x``. A granular particle-based simulation, e.g. growth Budding yeast colony [[7](#ref7)], which is studied further using network analysis [[8](#ref8)], could be also simulated, perhaps more simple, using ABM approach, where the physical rules can be simplified to reduce simulation time but sacrifice the details of system evolution, especially the time information.
