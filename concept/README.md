# Concept
After learning in brief Molecular Dynamics (MD) method, inventing [Single Fluid Volume Element (SFVE) method](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4895885) based on Finite Diference (FD) and MD for water flow in self-siphon, doing post-doc about [Multi-Collision Particle Dynamics (MPCD)](https://doi.org/10.13140/2.1.3523.0725), and implementing Agent-Based Model (ABM) for physical system, farming, and costumer dynamics, let's say a consiousness arises, which induces the birth of ``abm-x``.
