# Create Github page of a repository
Assume that your username is `user` and you have a repository with the name `repo`, which you want to have a Github page.

You should have already a repository with the name of `user.github.io` and the site can be accessed at `https://user.github.io`.

1. In you local machine navigate to `repo` folder.
2. Create `docs` folder in the `repo`.
3. Create `index.md` in that folder.
4. Write following content in the file
```
# abm-x
```
5. Commit the work with a message "create docs/index.md".
6. Push the work.
7. Login to your Github account.
8. Navigate to the repository `repo`.
9. Go to settings of `repo`.
10. Set Github pages with source is master branch `/docs` folder.
11. Test the main page `https://user.github.io/repo/`, which is now up.

It is a rewritten post that has been performed in pText but not documented, while learning and installing Jekyll for blogging. Rename it from `log.md` to `2020-05-19-create-github-page-of-a-repository` and later put it the `_posts` folder.
