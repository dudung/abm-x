# js-exam
Computational Physics final examination using JS and Github 

## Repository
It was stored originallya in [u2 of jsxphys](https://github.com/dudung/jsxphys/tree/master/0.0.2/u2)

## Version 0.0.2
This version is migrated from the personal project xPhysics chapter 92, where it is still in JavaScript code and not really a markup document. It uses [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) for equations and [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs) for xy scatter charts. An editor side-by-side with its output is made by `textarea` and `p`, two of the HTML DOM element objects. Charts are not with caption and reference.

## Note
This README is written using [Markdown Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here) and here is the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet).
